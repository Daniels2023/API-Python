GEOAPIFY and OPENWEATHERMAP

This project was based in these two API (Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap).

The VacationPy file used Geoapify to locate the nearest hotel close to the city center with the best weather in the world.
The WeatherPy file used OperWeatherMap to analyse and correlate the latitude with temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.
