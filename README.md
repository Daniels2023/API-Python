GEOAPIFY and OPENWEATHERMAP

This project was based in these two API (Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap).

The VacationPy file used Geoapify to locate the nearest hotel close to the city center with the best weather in the world.
Best weather is based on:
Average Temperature between 23C to 27C
The majority of the year with clear sky and pratically no wind.

Cities with the best weather:

The WeatherPy file used OperWeatherMap to analyse and correlate the latitude with temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.

It was used citiPy library to locate the nearest city based on random numPy latitude and longitude numbers.
